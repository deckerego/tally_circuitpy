# tally_circuitpy

Use CircuitPython to control your LEDs over HTTP

## Requirements

tally_circuitpy requires CircuitPython 7.0, which can be downloaded at
https://circuitpython.org/downloads and can be flashed according to your
board's instructions. Many ESP32-S2 boards follow similar ESPTool instructions as listed
[on Adafruit's Metro ESP32-S2](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-esp32-s2/rom-bootloader)
learn page. If you are flashing with the ESPTool, make sure to flash with the
`.bin` file (_not_ the `.uf2` file).

tally_circuitpy also requires that the
[ampule.py library](https://github.com/deckerego/ampule)
be installed into the base directory.
